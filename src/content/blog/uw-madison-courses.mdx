Below are the courses I've taken at UW-Madison. 
The credit count for each course is in parenthesis; if a credit count isn't indicated, a course is three credits. I initially declared a double major in Computer Sciences 
and Legal Studies. But, I dropped Legal Studies and picked up a Math certificate (equivalent to a minor). I'm also pursuing Honors in the Liberal Arts 
and Honors in the Major for Computer Sciences. Both of these require a slightly more intense course load via honors courses.
Some courses are seminars or passion courses created by one professor and taking them with another may result in a vastly difference experience. For those classes, I'll include the professor's name.

For UW-Madison CS Majors and *especially* incoming students, I highly recommend looking at [Michael Noguera's course map](https://www.noguera.dev/course-map/).
