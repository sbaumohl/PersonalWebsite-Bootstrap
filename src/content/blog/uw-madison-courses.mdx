Below are the courses I’ve taken at UW-Madison. The credit count for each course is in parentheses; if a credit count isn’t indicated, a course is three credits. I initially declared a double major in Computer Sciences and Legal Studies. But, I dropped Legal Studies and picked up a Math certificate (equivalent to a minor). I’m also pursuing Honors in the Liberal Arts and Honors in the Major for Computer Sciences. Both require a slightly more intense course load via honors courses. Some courses are seminars or passion courses created by one professor, and taking them with another may result in a vastly different experience. For those classes, I’ll include the professor’s name.

For UW-Madison CS Majors and *especially* incoming students, I highly recommend looking at [Michael Noguera's course map](https://www.noguera.dev/course-map/). 


#### Legend:
- (<span class="font-bold">!</span>): Particularly challenging, intense, or required many hours of work

[^os-note]: While I usually encourage people only to take elective courses that interest them, the Operating Systems course at Madison is fantastic, and not taking it wastes a valuable opportunity.
